# ERD
!["ERD"](https://github.com/meghein/bmg-quiz-party/blob/master/public/images/quizzard_erd.png)

# WIREFRAMES
- Sketch a wireframe with a prototyping tool like Figma
- A sketch of what the app will work like with box layout

# DATA
- Define what data you need -  for quiz: users, quizzes: questions, choices, responses
- Build an ERD (with draw.io) - look at entity relationships, PKs (id), FKs (user_id), table names plural

# ROUTES
- follow REST:
  HTTP method | URL pattern   | Use
  GET         | /quizzes      | show all quizzes
  GET         | /quizzes/new  | show create new quiz form  
  POST        | /quizzes      | create new quiz 
  GET         | /quizzes/:id  | show a quiz
  DELETE      | /quizzes/:id  | delete a quiz

  GET         | /login        | retrieves the login form
  POST        | /login        | sends user credentials to db
  
  POST        | /quizzes/:id/results  | saves results of active users' attempt of a quiz, on quiz submit
  GET         | /quizzes/:id/results  | show results of all users' attempt of a specific quiz
  GET         | /users/:id/results    | show results of single user's total different quiz attempts

# STACK CHOICE
- Bootstrap, sass, jquery, express, node, postgresql

# SINGLE PAGE VS MULTI-PAGE APP
- SPA: HTML generated dynamically by JS on the client, AJX requests, no page reload
- MPA: EJS, sends response as full HTML, page reload

# DIVIDING TASKS
- Vertical: break into features, priortize features, each dev build a feature full stack
- Horizontal: break in tech domains, dev responsible for an entire domain, domains could be ui, api (routes), db

# COMMUNICATION - TEAMWORK
- be willing to let some things go
- give feedback kindly
- do what you say you'll do
- Trello: project management tool
- Slack: communication

# PROJECT WORKFLOW
- NEVER CODE ON MASTER
- Database setup:
  psql -U vagrant -d template1
  CREATE ROLE labber WITH LOGIN password 'labber';
  CREATE DATABASE midterm OWNER labber;
- Git Repo setup:
  fork and clone template
  change env. file: change database name to what you call yours, leave labber user
  npm install
  npm rebuild node sass
  npm run db:reset - might have to do a few times during project to reset db
  npm run local (for nodemon - runs on port 8080)
- PUBLIC FOLDER - static assets
- ROUTES - user (/api/users) and widget (/widgets/routes) routes
- Buld a dbHelpers.js file to store functions for db access
- To test POST requests.. could use Insomnia, Postman or curl

# GIT BRANCH
- git checkout -b feature/setup - or whatever you want to call the branch
- when ready to merge to master: 
  git checkout master
  git pull
  git merge feature/setup
